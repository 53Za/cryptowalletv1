To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to introduce a program I have developed to validate Bitcoin private keys and check their associated addresses for blockchain activity. This tool is designed to assist users in verifying the validity of Bitcoin private keys and determining whether the corresponding addresses have been used on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Program Overview

The program is written in Python and leverages the bitcoinlib library for key and address validation, as well as the Blockchain.info API to check for blockchain activity. It is designed to process a list of private keys from a file, validate each key, and provide detailed information about the associated Bitcoin address, including its balance and transaction history.

Key Features

Private Key Validation:
The program validates whether a given private key is a valid Bitcoin private key.
It uses the bitcoinlib library to derive the corresponding Bitcoin address.
Blockchain Activity Check:
For each valid private key, the program checks the associated Bitcoin address for activity using the Blockchain.info API.
It retrieves the address's balance and total received Bitcoin (in BTC).
File Processing:
The program reads a list of private keys from a text file.
It skips invalid lines (e.g., headers, empty lines, or improperly formatted data).
User-Friendly Output:
The program provides a detailed summary of each private key, including:
Validation status (valid or invalid).
Associated Bitcoin address.
Balance and total received Bitcoin.
Usability (whether the key has been used on the blockchain).
A final summary report is displayed, showing the total number of keys checked, valid keys, and keys with blockchain activity.
Error Handling:
The program handles errors gracefully, including:
Invalid private keys.
File read errors (e.g., missing or corrupted files).
API errors (e.g., network issues or rate limits).
How It Works

The user provides a text file containing a list of Bitcoin private keys (one per line).
The program reads the file, filters out invalid lines, and processes each private key.
For each valid private key, the program:
Derives the corresponding Bitcoin address.
Queries the Blockchain.info API to check for blockchain activity.
Displays the results in a clear and concise format.
The program outputs a summary report at the end of the process.
Use Cases

This program is particularly useful for:

Wallet Recovery: Verifying whether a list of private keys corresponds to active Bitcoin addresses.
Security Audits: Checking the validity and usage of private keys in a wallet or backup.
Educational Purposes: Learning how Bitcoin private keys and addresses work.
Example Output




To use the program:

Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy
pip install bitcoinlib requests
Prepare a text file containing Bitcoin private keys (one per line).
Run the program and provide the path to the text file when prompted.
Conclusion

This program is a powerful and user-friendly tool for validating Bitcoin private keys and checking their blockchain activity. It is designed to be easy to use while providing robust error handling and detailed output. I hope you find it useful for your Bitcoin-related projects.
